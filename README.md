# A-Multi-Embedding-Fusion-Method-for-Cluster-Based-Recommendation-Systems
In the Top-N recommendation system, as the size of the database grows, the calculation cost will be greatly increased when sorting items. In order to solve such problems, it is usually combined with candidate generation and re-ranking. Therefore, how to generate the highest quality and representative candidates becomes important. In this paper, the trained item embeddings are grouped through candidate generation, then the neural network is used to predict the set of candidate items closest to each user. Finally, we combine the triple loss to train new user embeddings and item embeddings to re-rank the recommended items. We experimented on MovieLens and Yelp data sets. The Recall, Precision, Hit Rank and ARHR of each data set are displayed. Compared with the current methods, this paper can better select items with user preferences and accelerate the speed of re-ranking.
